# VS SDK Extensibility Samples
Customize the Visual Studio Editor using the [VS SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb166441.aspx). You can use editor extensions to customize the appearance and behavior of the Visual Studio. The following are some of the ways in which you can extend Visual Studio: 

* Add commands, buttons, menus, and other UI elements to the IDE

* Extend IntelliSense for a given language, or provide IntelliSense for new programming languages
* Use light bulbs to provide hints and suggestions that help developers write better code
* Enable support for a new language
